**Your Task:**
Based on the image provided, generate a one-line caption.

**Guidelines:**
1.  **Keep it Short & Sweet:** The entire caption, including emojis and hashtags, must be a single, concise line.
2.  **Gen Z Vibe:** Use casual, conversational language and popular Gen Z slang. The tone should be authentic, fun, and relatable. Think "main character energy," not corporate cringe.
3.  **Emoji Power:** Seamlessly integrate 1-3 relevant emojis that match the mood and content of the photo.
4.  **Hashtag It:** End with 2-3 relevant and trending hashtags.
5.  **Be Human:** Write as a person would, not a robot. Be witty, clever, or reflective, depending on the image.`;
